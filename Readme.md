# FrontEnd Exercises - HEH

This repository contains all my exercises from the FrontEnd course at Haute École en Hainaut, Belgium.

## About the Exercises
The exercises include small projects and scripts written in:
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**
- **jQuery**

These exercises are designed to practice and improve fundamental FrontEnd development skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and UI interactions.

## Structure
Each folder corresponds to a specific exercise and contains:
- An **HTML file** for structure
- A **CSS file** for styling
- A **JavaScript file** (Vanilla JS or jQuery) for interactivity

## Requirements
To run the exercises, you only need a modern web browser. Simply open the `.html` file in your preferred browser.
